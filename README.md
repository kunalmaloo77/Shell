# My Custom POSIX-Compliant Shell in C++

This is my personal project where I built a fully functional POSIX-compliant shell from scratch in C++. It interprets shell commands, executes external programs, and supports built-in commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, and more. Through this, I explored shell parsing, REPL implementation, process management, and system calls.

## Key Features

- Command parsing and execution
- Built-in command support (e.g., `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`)
- External program launching with argument handling
- Basic error handling and signal management

## Why I Built This

I created this shell to deepen my understanding of operating systems and low-level programming. It's a showcase of my C++ skills, including string manipulation, fork/exec, and environment management. This is not a starter template—it's my completed implementation for demonstration purposes.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/kunalmaloo77/Shell.git`
2. Ensure `cmake` is installed.
3. Build and run: `./your_program.sh` (implements the shell in `src/main.cpp`).

## Technologies Used

- C++ (standard library)
- CMake for building
- POSIX APIs (fork, exec, wait, etc.)
